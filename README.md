Project Title: SupBot

Deployed Page: 

Project Description: An app that allows a user to pick what items they want from Supreme that week and a bot will buy the items for them. 

More about Supreme: Supreme is a skateboard clothing company that has been around for 25 years and has developed a following of hypebeast customers. Supreme has done collaborations with companies like Louis Vuitton, Swarovski, The North Face, and Commes Des Garcons. These collabs and the hype behind the brand lead to people paying rediculous amounts of money for resold items. For example, the Supreme Louis Vuitton Hoodie went for $1200 and now resells for $8000.

Breakdown of Tasks: 

* Build the bot using Puppeteer Js.
* Incorporate authentication so that only certified users can use the bot.
* Build a page that will show the future drop items and hold the users items they want to purchase.
* Then send that user to a page where they will have an estimated total and a form to input credit card data.
* Store users item picks in React state then use CRON to fire off the bot at the correct time for the drop.
